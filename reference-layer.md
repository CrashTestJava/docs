Reference layers are a way to show reference images at higher resolutions than the canvas. Reference layers cannot be drawn on or edited.

There are a few ways to create a reference layer. To create one from a file, use *Layer > New > New Reference Layer from File*. To paste one in from the clipboard, use *Edit > Paste Special > Paste as New Reference Layer*.
